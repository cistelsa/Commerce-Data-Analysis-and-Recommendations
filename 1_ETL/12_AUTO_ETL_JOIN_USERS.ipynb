They then came up with some story claiming that they had a mess up in the system. We talk to the general manager the next morning and she claims she will take care of everything. We get back that evening and our rooms were not cleaned during the day. I had to clean our own room. Talk with the manager again and when we check out she decides to only give us a single night after all the problems. The pillow case had a stain on it. Letting someone have the key to our room. Not cleaning during the day when we ask them to. The breakfast is a joke.

They take great care of their clients needs and are even great with kids! My daughter is 8 and has a bad habit of biting her nails down to below her finger tip. Cara did a great job of doing dipping powder with a fake nail and ensured it was age appropriate and didn't go past her finger tip 🤗 I work in a corporate office and they ensured my nails were not only BEAUTIFUL but, work appropriate. I was recommended this place by a friend so, I followed them on IG and after scrolling through their pictures I saw why they are highly sought out. There is no other place I would ever trust with me or my daughter's nails *note: if you go, make an appointment or expect for a rather long wait but it's worth it*","6":"[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsulhQvhpwo_yXCBKuK_tmilMqn2Aa_Vdtk8Dw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","7":"{'time': 1557713114162, 'text': 'Loved reading your review!

I was told I can either say who I want or come in and wait and this came from Tom the owner. I work in Customer Service and I naturally try to work with everyone in a customer service related business as I know what it entails. When I asked why he was being so disagreeable he then hung up in my face. I wasn't expecting such blatant disrespect and was very upset by the encounter as I've been going there for a couple years now. I've even recommended it to others but I was shown today my business isn't welcome there.\n\nEDIT: Since they truly value the opinion of their customers and how we're treated (please understand I'm being facetious), I received the same standard reply that they've sent anyone who didn't like the service there. It's really sad how nonchalant and uncaring they are about how they make people feel.","6":"NULL","7":"{'time': 1580436661380, 'text': \"Thank you for your honest review.

I'm not one to claim anything unless it's the truth. I contacted the hotel they said that someone would be in touch with me within the week. 2 weeks went by and I heard nothing. I contacted them again and they opened a case. Today they have contacted me accusing me of falsely accusing them of saying they have bugs. So I wont worry about my money wrongfully spent.

The service was friendly and quick. The Tavern is in a restored building from an 18th century estate. Cool location and the food was excellent. Remember I am relating it based on the type of restaurant. Fine dining is also available on property, but this is a Tavern. The bar is nice and there are multiple dining areas. There are only three beers on tap, but the IPA I had was tasty. We both got the pulled pork sandwich. The pork was well cooked, well pulled - a nice blend of small and medium pieces. The sauce was nice and let the pork shine through. I have eaten lots of BBQ across the country and this pulled pork reminds me of some of the best I have had in Kansas City. We will definitely go back and I highly recommend it.","6":"NULL","7":"NULL","8":"Virginia","index":406},{"0":"0x89ad6148906676a3:0x6beb6646d90ac50d","1":"1.1132567426383725E20","2":"Victor Lasher","3":"1599838804710","4":"5","5":"We stayed at Berry Hill over Labor Day weekend as a simple get away from everything trip.

I felt bad for the groom and bride whose night was supposed to be as stress free as possible and they had to deal with that. It was so bad the wedding party was getting the good off of the tray and serving them. If given the choice I would not make a purposeful trip back to this place.

He informed us that there were only smoking rooms left and not being the picky type we agree and said that was fine. He gave us room keys and we went on our way to our room. Upon entering the room (217) it was dark and dingy we immediately felt uncomfortable. Before we could step food in the door we could see the bed were filthy. The comforters had massive rips and burn holes as well as the carpet on the floor. Cobwebs covered the lamps and there was a white powdery substance on the floor along with marijuana stems. It clearly had not been vacuumed. I immediately turned the sheets down the check the beds and there were urine stains as well as what appeared to be blood on the sheets. With out hesitation we went back the the front desk and asked for a more suitable room. Puzzled the gentleman asked what the problem was we explained he didn’t seem to believe us. However he did put us in a different room. Upon entering room number 2 (130) it was equally sketchy. The comforters looked like they came out of a dumpster and the sheets still did not look very clean the shower curtain had black mold growing on it along with other disgusting unknown mold. We sat in the room trying to figure out a second plan because we had just spent the last of our money on that room. (Over $100 for one night). We have a 4 year old and I was not comfortable letting her sleep in those beds. While I sat in the bed I looked over at the night stand and once again spotted BLOOD! Not just a little spot it was running down the entire night stand. Without hesitation we grab our daughter and checked out immediately. (Not to mention the drug deals that were going on in the parking lot the entire time we were there).  The three of us ended up sleeping in the car.  We were there a total of 2 hours. If I could leave 0 Stars I would. I’m extremely disappointed that we couldn’t get a refund. No one should ever have to pay for  or stay in conditions like that.","6":"NULL","7":"NULL","8":"Virginia","index":437},{"0":"0x89ba8323127c81bd:0xa5039854c55c5e15","1":"1.1661096537205278E20","2":"Amber Slovek","3":"1569431082274","4":"3","5":"I travel quite bit to the area,  safe area good value.","6":"NULL","7":"NULL","8":"Virginia","index":438},{"0":"0x89ba8323127c81bd:0xa5039854c55c5e15","1":"1.1206411584622602E20","2":"john chavez","3":"1560014207897","4":"5","5":"Great value, very comfortable colors, decent furniture, and i did not see any bugs.

night of hearing the waves break and the sound of the ocean we plan to go back once the pool is open for the supper we enjoyed ourselves it was quite no loud noise and the front desk was very helpful and I would rate more than 5 stars but it only allows 5 stars but deff if u looking for a good place to have a great family stay or a night out ask for Beach View on the 2 nd Floor and any room past 204 going toward the right is what room u want they got the best beach views from 204 to the Right of coming up steps deff try this place and have a good time like we

Once seated, we waited for over 5 minutes for a server to approach is to see if we'd been helped.  It wasn't long till plates started piling up and not a server to be found again.  To make matters worse, we found out after being seated and told of the night's main items, ribs and steak.  If ribs and steak are the main meats, how do you run out at 7pm on a Thursday night?\n\nMost items on the bar were fairly low as well.  While we were there, we saw at least 3 cooks standing around the back, 2-3 \"managers\" walking about and at least 5 or 6 servers.  As you can see in my attached photo, everyone just stood around ignoring the customers.  Our bottle of water at the table ran out early on after the initial fills, and we never were asked about a refill.  The table was bussed once during that hour.  Finally, we had to ask for our check after waiting for way too long to try and get anyone's attention.\n\nAll this would normally be overlooked, but there were only 6 seated tables inside and another 4 outside.  To have so many staff on hand not paying attention to tables as very poor customer service.  To run out of the main items on a slow night is very poor planning.  For the price, I can think of many other places to go instead.  Luckily, there are over 4,000 restaurants to choose from in Hampton Roads, so there's at least a silver lining!","6":"[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkw89fyf9oDGRCzxgtmmAoDfRfDJ-f4QT2d_YC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNk0PElZEif4by3L5s3xHMTCrZkQJOUMoU4PO-v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","7":"{'time': 1529324080484, 'text': 'We are so sorry to hear that you did not have a good experience with us during our BBQ on the Terrace event.

It was disappointing because I've looked forward to trying it out for years.\n\nI spent over $200 for 4 people here and was not impressed with the selection, service, and food quality.\n\nFirst, the salad bar was sad sad sad. Only 4 or so toppings to choose from, four salad dressings, and one type of not so fresh greens mix. There was a nearby \"cheese bar\" but I wouldn't call it that.... bunches of cheese on a tray that looked like from a Walmart platter with no plates or crackers or toppings is not that great.\n\nThe raw bar was probably the nicest element - a large bar with shrimp, salmon, and fresh raw oysters on ice. The shrimp and salmon were very good and my dad and boyfriend enjoyed the oysters, I don't eat them raw.\n\nThe hot food sections were equally disappointing. No steak, chicken, or prime rib. They did have some absolutely delicious and moist turkey at a carving station with gravy. That was very good. They had fatty beef and fatty brisket smothered in BBQ sauce. The sides were very dry roasted potatoes, bland corn with bacon pieces, Brussel sprouts and roasted bacon squash topped with a small piece of cheese and a cranberry. The squash was the standout. Nearby they had some rolls under a heat lamp - white and sweet potatoes. Often out of plates, no butter for a long period of time and when it did come out, it was frozen solid. A HUGE pet peeve of mine at a \"fancy\" place. Butter should never be frozen to be spread on bread. Ever. The rolls were hard and tasted like they were made a week ago, also, not warm. My boyfriend's 11-year old daughter commented they were like dog biscuits. I couldn't agree more.\n\nThe dessert bar was disappointing as well. I hoped for this to be the highlight. It wasn't. Several selections like cheesecake, bread pudding, chocolate cake, a peppermint swirl cake and Christmas cookies were \"laid out\" on a table outside the main buffet hall. Again, no plates, no refills of the items at the end of the night, they just ran out and it never got refilled.... the cakes were not moist and they were bland and tasteless with cheap whipped icing. Also, with no management the table was covered in crumbs and children and teens were sawing at cakes that were not pre-portioned or sliced to try to pick them up with tiny utensils. I even struggled... it was not well managed and was poor display and delivery of this.\n\nThe coffee and tea were good.\n\nService was OK. They were polite but continuously told us they were working Christmas Eve and were tired. We were also chastised for placing our own plates on the nearby tray to bus our tables despite the fact they weren't around to collect them and we needed to clear room.\n\nOverall, not worth $200.

It was filthy, the beds were old and linens were stained and had cigarette burns in them. The stairs were not sound and myself and my partner fell twice. There were drug deals going on all night and one of the people involved was the person  pushing the maids cart. I am not sure what they were doing because the grounds were filthy, trash was not emptied the entire time we were there (3 days) and we had to go to the office to use the microwave and there was no coffee at all. I have several photos of all of this. We could not book another room last minute and had no choice but to stay here. I got season passes to an amusement park in the area but will not be staying here again. I plan on calling the inspector.

Several times I saw sketchy characters hanging out in the parking lot and the front desk had a thick glass window for night use.\n\nWhen I checked in, the clerk seemed so unhappy to be working. She barely spoke as she checked me in at the counter. I had requested a ground level floor but was given a room on the second floor.\n\nThe room was dated, with paint peeling from the walls. The mattress was low quality. Cable was available but every time I changed a channel, the TV lost signal for one to two minutes before the next channel would play. There was no guide so finding something to watch was frustrating.\n\nI could swear that when I booked the room it had free Wi-Fi. When I tried that, visible networks all said $3 a night in the name. The one with signal enough to be of use was what I tried and the home page was a Motel 6 page asking for the guest password. I called the front desk and the unhappy woman told me the password. I tried it and it did not work. After several variations with capital letters, I called the unhappy woman back. She said any of the networks that say $3 will take that password. I asked her about the one I was trying, which said $3 on it and was an open network, and she told me that network was only for employees to use. She was surly and I was too tired to fight about it. It makes no sense that the landing page for the strong network asked for the GUEST password. I tried several times to use the weaker networks but couldn't stay connected for more than a minute or two. I gave up.\n\nThe next morning I had to get up early and when I went to shower, the dial on the shower turned indefinitely in either direction. Turning it left should have produced hot water, but all I got was cold and ice cold. The sink had plenty of hot water so I ended up using that.\n\nWhen I went to check out, it was roughly 5:45 AM. Faced with the bullet proof glass barrier I saw the night before, I waited and watched as a different clerk shuffled toward the window, rubbing sleep from her eyes and looking bewildered. I tried to tell her I was checking out and about the shower. She pointed at a crudely chiseled out hole in the wall that said key drop. I put the key in, but tried again to tell her about the shower. She had to lean her head to the glass and open the drawer to hear, and then asked me if I wanted to check in. Unbelievable.","6":"NULL","7":"{'time': 1545350616911, 'text': \"Dear Ed,\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to post your review.

The room we selected was for a Queen. However the mattress was definitely a Full. It was hard and rather lumpy. There was a sheet, two very thin blankets, and a very thin and scratchy comforter. All of the bedding had various staining, and the pillows themselves were also lumpy. The room floor itself was clean, as was the table. The only other thing of note was the hole in the wall. All in all, it wasn't too bad for $40 for one night. I'm not expecting a 4 star experience for that price, but I do expect a clean bathroom and bed.","6":"NULL","7":"{'time': 1517937074425, 'text': \"Dear Rachel, Thank you for taking the time to share your review.

During my stays I was in two different rooms on the second and first floors. I went here because of the price; my family and I are in transition and I went to Williamsburg alone to seek employment and a home. The comforters and dust covers are dingy, probably washed annually or semi-annually. I have reason to suspect the floors are vacuumed on the same frequency. The cleanest areas for both stays were the restrooms. On the one occasion I spoke with the manager and asked him to have my room vacuumed and dusted, it was not done during the course of the day. At the time of my visit the grounds were undergoing renovation and littered with paint chips, cigarette butts, and other debris. The side parking lot had the scent of death about it.","6":"NULL","7":"NULL","8":"Virginia","index":837},{"0":"0x89b08956ff1107e3:0x759b7773c85f50d9","1":"1.0365668535312518E20","2":"Charles Stellete","3":"1555375143926","4":"1","5":"Will never stay there again a long travel day to get to the room and it was filthy dirty","6":"NULL","7":"NULL","8":"Virginia","index":838},{"0":"0x89b08956ff1107e3:0x759b7773c85f50d9","1":"1.1517621002074831E20","2":"Kris Redman","3":"1496695429474","4":"1","5":"The room i got was terrible the desk was broken, holes in the wall, ac vent was rusty and falling out the ceiling.

Upon registration the clerk said would you like to look at the room first because we do not give refunds. RED FLAG!! Looked around, pulled covers back checked mattress crevices, covers, bathroom etc. Being that we arrived late(7pm) due to traffic we were tired so we accepted the room against our better judgement. Once we were in the room we began lysoling everything. We had lysol wipes, spray and antibacterial spray. I think I killed the remote wiping it a cazillion times. We noticed the bed spread had cigarette holes burned in it, and several stains. The rooms were tiny, and smelly. The air conditioner filters probably haven't been changed since they were put in. Our noses were clogged, and we were stuffy, and sneezing all night. The room felt wet if that makes any since. To much condensation from the air conditioner I suppose. They replaced the bathtub with a tiny shower about the size of a shower on a cruise without a removable shower head. Very hard to wash yourself because when you bend to wash, your head/hair is touching one side your, butt is touching the other, and rinsing was almost impossible for the same reason. They had a raised sink INSIDE the bathroom, but there wasn't one OUTSIDE of the bathroom which is inconvenient if you just need to wash your hands and someone is in the bathroom. The towel holder was cute, but the towels felt like the owners have never heard of fabric softener, as well as the scratchy, woolly, lint infested blankets. Thank god there was no carpet because I'm sure it would have been gross, instead they had a faux wood floor, which of course takes away from the coziness of a carpeted room. To top it all off right before we were ready for bed I saw (OH GOODNESS) 2 ROACHES coming from the ajoining door. We killed them and prayed we would make it through the night without taking one home. We shook everything and search our items thoroughly before we left the next morning, and unpacked on the back deck. So far so good, haven't seen any creatures. Steer clear of the motel 6 on Richmond rd, Williamsburg, Va. The staff was nice though.","6":"NULL","7":"NULL","8":"Virginia","index":841},{"0":"0x89b08956ff1107e3:0x759b7773c85f50d9","1":"1.0633378946281864E20","2":"Rob Pully","3":"1488338037716","4":"4","5":"easy. ... cheap...... relatively clean.... get a room, take a shower,  go to sleep. ..","6":"NULL","7":"NULL","8":"Virginia","index":842},{"0":"0x89b08956ff1107e3:0x759b7773c85f50d9","1":"1.1212042556869671E20","2":"lioness dennison","3":"1557235040366","4":"1","5":"If I could give it less than a star in would, scary people stay there","6":"NULL","7":"NULL","8":"Virginia","index":843},{"0":"0x89b08956ff1107e3:0x759b7773c85f50d9","1":"1.0124748103247512E20","2":"Johnnie Meredith","3":"1527127148314","4":"5","5":"Decent room at a great price.","6":"NULL","7":"NULL","8":"Virginia","index":844},{"0":"0x89b08956ff1107e3:0x759b7773c85f50d9","1":"1.1015980316130995E20","2":"Jeffrey Norford","3":"1526223702559","4":"5","5":"Room was clean.

The room keys would always be deactivated on our second night stay and we would have to go back to the lobby and ask for new ones. When asked if the key problem is frequent with other guests as well, she said \"yup\", like she was trying to defend herself. Horrible customer  service.
